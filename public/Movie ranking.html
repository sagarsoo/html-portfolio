<h1>The Best Movies According to Sagar</h1>
<h2>My Best watched movies from past year</h2>
<hr/>
<h3>Ford vs Ferrari (2019)</h3>
<p> This movie is basically over a famous Race car driver Ken Miles. 
    And the history behind the ford motors and rivelvery between ford motors and ferrari.</p>
<p> And my favourite Line or a dialoug from this movie goes like.... <br/>
    There's a point at 7,000 RPM... where everything fades. 
    The machine becomes weightless. Just disappears. 
    And all that's left is a body moving through space
    and time. 7,000 RPM. That's where you meet it. 
    You feel it coming. It creeps up on you, 
    close in your ear. Asks you a question. 
    The only question that matters. Who are you?</p>
<h3>Lamborghini: The Man Behind the Legend (2022)</h3>
    <p>In this movie theres a history of Ferrari and 
        Lamborghini, and how Lamborghini came to an 
        existence by just repairing cars to making of cars.</p>
        <p>And my favourite line from this movie goes like... 
            <br/>
            You buy a Ferrari when you want to be somebody, 
            You buy a Lamborghini when you are someone..
        </p>
<h3>Shutter Island (2010)</h3>
    <p>This movie was released in nearly a decead ago 
        but it has great storytelling and finnest movie one can watch
    with Leonardo DiCaprio as Teddy danials </p> 
    <p>And my favourite line from this movie goes like...
        <br/>
        Which would be worse, to live as a Monster 
        or die as a good man.
